**Project Name: PostgreSQL Data Pipeline**

**Overview:**
This project entails the creation of a robust data pipeline tailored specifically for PostgreSQL databases. The pipeline encompasses the Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) processes necessary for efficient data management and manipulation.

**Features:**

1. **Custom `wait_for_postgres` Function:**
   - Ensures the readiness of the source PostgreSQL database before initiating the ELT process.
   - Utilizes Python's `subprocess` module for executing shell commands, enhancing reliability and error handling.

2. **Secure Authentication:**
   - Implements environment variables for PostgreSQL user credentials, ensuring secure data handling without manual intervention.

3. **SQL Optimization Techniques:**
   - Demonstrates proficiency in SQL optimization techniques, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and dynamic SQL generation with Jinja templating and macros in dbt.
   - Ensures efficient data transformations and maintainable code for enhanced scalability and reliability.

4. **Distributed Computing Structure:**
   - Illustrates expertise in distributed computing structures, particularly Airflow.
   - Emphasizes scalability, reliability, and resource allocation for optimized workflow management.

**Usage:**

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Update database configurations in the script (`source_config`, `destination_config`) as per your PostgreSQL setup.
   - Set environment variables for PostgreSQL user credentials to enable secure authentication.

3. **Execution:**
   - Run the script to initiate the data pipeline.
   - Follow the prompts and logs for real-time progress monitoring.
